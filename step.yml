title: Restore Gradle configuration cache
summary: Restores the Gradle configuration cache folder used by Gradle. Uses the Bitrise Build Cache infrastructure.
description: |
    This step restores the Gradle configuration cache folder from the Bitrise Build Cache to speed up future builds. 

    For more information on how configuration caching works, refer to the [Gradle user guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html).

    **IMPORTANT NOTES:**
    - You must have an active Bitrise Build Cache Trial or Subscription for your workspace to use this step.
    - You also need to set up the encryption key `GRADLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in Bitrise Secrets by using the result from running `openssl rand -base64 16`.
    - Setting the encryption key is supported only from Gradle version 8.6 onwards, so your project must be using Gradle 8.6 or higher.

      Custom override key used to restore the cache from a previously saved entry (by the `Save Gradle configuration cache` step).

      If not specified, by default a key is generated from the app slug and the current branch. If not specified, the contents can also be restored from a fallback key consisting only of the app slug. This helps reduce cache misses on new feature branches.
